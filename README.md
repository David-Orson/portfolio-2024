# My Portfolio for 2024!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

If you are looking at this you may be an employer, I have made this repository public so you can check out how I structure code in an efficient and organized manner, enabling scalability and maintainability on this project.

This is a simple static site built in react and served in a Docker container from a Digital Ocean droplet. Nginx and SSL have been handled in a Docker network. I have opted to use Styled Components over any UI library, and built out my own utility components.

I am not the strongest designer, so inspiration was taken from multiple developer portfolios I found on youtube reviews.
