# My Portfolio for 2024!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

If you are looking at this you may be an employer, I have made this repository public so you can check out how I structure code in an efficient and organized manner, enabling scalability and maintainability on this project.

This is a simple static site built in React and served in a Docker container from a Digital Ocean droplet. Nginx and SSL have been handled in a Docker network. I have opted to use Styled Components over any UI library, and built out my own utility components.

I am not the strongest designer, so inspiration was taken from multiple developer portfolios I found on youtube reviews.

I ran performance checks on this sites load and it consistently scores over 90 in performance when using Chromes Lighthouse tool, I optimized the images for data size and quality in this regard, the sweet spot was between 100kb and 300kb.

I have ensured this site is fully responsive, my approach was to not put together a single section that was not at any point responsive before committing. This way I ensure I don't overlook this important factor. I built this project with high attention to detail, and could have built it more quickly with simpler practices. However, I wanted to demonstrate my front end skills somewhat and also make it easier to extend this project in the future!

As standard with my deploy projects, there is an easy to use deploy bash script.
